# Task Tracker

An Elixir/Phoenix app to track tasks.

### Design decisions

* Removed "Users" from navigation. A logged in user should only see or edit its own 
* Separated completed and non completed tasks, and put non completed above as they should be more relevant to users

### To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
